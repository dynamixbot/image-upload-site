## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Installation

1. **Set up Supabase**
   
   a. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   
   b. Go to Storage and create a new bucket called `images`
   
   c. Make the bucket public by updating its settings:
   ```sql
   -- In your Supabase SQL editor, run:
   INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
   VALUES ('images', 'images', true);
   ```
   
   d. Set up storage policies (in Supabase Dashboard > Storage > Policies):
   ```sql
   -- Allow public uploads
   CREATE POLICY "Allow public uploads" ON storage.objects
   FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'images');
   
   -- Allow public access
   CREATE POLICY "Allow public access" ON storage.objects
   FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'images');
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```
   
   You can find these in your Supabase project settings under "API".

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Visit `http://localhost:4321` to see your image upload site!
